# In Tank 3D Perception

This project involves designing and testing a simulation of the Movex M-27 mini dozer for hazardous environments, specifically focusing on nuclear waste tank cleaning. The simulation aims to analyze the traversability of the mini dozer, determining the conditions under which the robot might tip over as it moves within a nuclear waste tank. The analysis utilizes Jolt Physics and Godot for accurate simulations, and terrain data is randomly generated due to the unavailability of LiDAR data. The primary objective is to ensure safe and effective movement of the robot in hazardous environments by understanding its stability under different conditions.
